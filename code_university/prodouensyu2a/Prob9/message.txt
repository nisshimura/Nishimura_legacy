Jitsugaku is a way of learning about the world pursued 
by Keio Universityâ€™s founder Yukichi Fukuzawa through 
the application of reason, observation, and verification, 
and it stemmed from his desire to break free of the Confucian 
ideals that informed scholarship in 19th-century Japan. 
Jitsugaku is science in the truest sense of the word and 
a powerful tool in Keio University's never-ending search 
for practical solutions to real-life problems.
